My next step is, that I want to plot some statistics for specific products. For example: how did the review-ratings from a specific product develop over time. So I would like to specify a period of time (e.g. 01.2016 - 03.2016) and than formulate one query that returns 10 or 15 Points in time (within the range) with the average rating of the reviews in this period. So that i can plot a Chart from that. I found ways with Spring Data to get the average for one period (Between x and y), but then I would have to make 10 queries to the database (for each dot). So I want to know, if it is possible to formulate a query with spring data that splits a time-period in a fixed number of sub-periods and gets the average of customer-ratings within each sub-period? If yes, how can I achieve that?",
